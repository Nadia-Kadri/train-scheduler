# What the project does
Train-scheduler is a front end app that uses Firebase to host train arrival and departure times as well as additional train details. User's can enter their own train information in the form provided. User controls are set up to prevent invalid numbers, invalid times, and incomplete entries. Upon new entries, the app will retrieve the train information and manipulate the times using Moment.js. Arrival times and minutes remaining are all real-time.
